# ConsoleCalculator

By <a href="http://jrliv.com/about/" target="_blank">Jae Logan</a>

## Description

A simple console calculator created with C#. I created this project with the goal of creating a calculator that can be ran and used quickly in the console. I also wanted to practice working with loops and conditionals, focusing on the switch statement. Which is why I used it to implement the calculation logic.

##	Usage

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project. I'm not planning on changing or updating it so I included the executable file. If you're using Windows and you just want to run and play with it you can download and run <a href="https://github.com/jrliv/ConsoleCalculator/blob/master/ConsoleCalculator.exe" target="_blank">the executable</a>.
